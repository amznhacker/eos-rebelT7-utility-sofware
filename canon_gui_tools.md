## Command-Line Scripts Included

All the command-line scripts I created can do everything EOS Utility does:

- `canon_remote_control.sh` - Remote camera control and settings
- `canon_tethered_shoot.sh` - Tethered shooting
- `canon_bulk_download.sh` - Bulk image download
- `canon_timelapse.sh` - Time-lapse photography
- `start_canon_webcam.sh` - Webcam mode (EOS Utility doesn't even have this!)

## Why Open Source is Better

1. **No Proprietary Restrictions** - Use any camera, any system
2. **More Features** - Webcam mode, scripting, automation
3. **Privacy** - No telemetry, no data collection
4. **Customization** - Modify and extend as needed
5. **Cross-Platform** - Works on Linux, macOS, Windows
6. **Free Forever** - No license fees, no subscriptions
